        <h2>Important Announcement: Offlinery is Shutting Down</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Offlinery User,</p>
        <p>I hope this message finds you well. After much consideration and analysis, I'm writing to share that we've made the difficult decision to shut down Offlinery, effective end of February 2025.</p>

        <div class="task-box">
            <p><strong>Why We're Closing Our Doors</strong></p>
            <p>Despite the incredible interest and support from users like you (which honestly exceeded our expectations), we've encountered significant challenges in coming up with a model that makes the platform profitable without +100k active users. Over the past few months, we've observed structural patterns and user behaviors that have revealed scaling obstacles we didn't anticipate when we first launched this journey.</p>
            <p>The reality is that the resources required to grow Offlinery to profitability are substantially greater than our initial calculations suggested. As entrepreneurs, sometimes the hardest part is knowing when to pivot rather than persist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verification-container">
            <p><strong>What This Means For You</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Data: All user data will be permanently deleted on 01 March 2025.</li>
                <li>Service Access: You'll continue to have full access to all features until 28 February 2025.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="emphasis">
            <p>A Personal Note: This wasn't an easy call to make. What began as a passion project taught us invaluable lessons about building products that don't just resonate with real needs but are reasonable to scale. Your enthusiasm and feedback showed us we were onto something meaningful, even if the business model ultimately proved challenging.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The connections and insights we've gained through creating Offlinery will inform whatever we build next. For that opportunity, we're deeply grateful.</p>
